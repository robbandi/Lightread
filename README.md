This is a Next.js project designed to help users improve their reading and vocabulary skills. The app has two main components: a random article generator that allows users to read a randomly selected article, and a text analysis module that uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide definitions, phonetics, and Wikipedia links for each word in the article or user input. This can help users learn new words and expand their vocabulary while reading.

To use this project, clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then, run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

Enjoy reading random articles and improving your vocabulary with Lightread ðŸ’¡ðŸ“š.
